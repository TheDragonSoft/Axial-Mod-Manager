## 2025-05-18 - Prevented list item re-renders with React.memo and useCallback

**Learning:** In Axial's React frontend, parent components like `BrowsePage` (search inputs) and `InstalledPage` (mod management status updates) re-render frequently. Unmemoized item components (`ModCard` and `ModRow`) re-rendered every item on every keystroke or status change, causing noticeable main-thread overhead for long mod lists.

**Action:** Wrap card and row components in `React.memo` and stabilize event handler functions passed as props using `useCallback`. Ensure side effects (such as data fetching on expand) remain within event handlers rather than state updaters or effects with unstable dependency arrays.
